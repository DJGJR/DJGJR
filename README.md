- 👋 Hi, I’m @DJGJR
- 👀 I’m interested in music, economics, baseball, social science, people, ideas, and the universe...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R by reading blogs, watching videos, and reading books. I would like to apply R programming to help with processing the large volumes of data that music companies have to deal with on a daily basis. I would also like to learn more about econometrics and mathematical economics to find ways to apply them to music industry analysis as well as other fileds of interest. ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project in R that will help me learn how to use it. Anything realated to music data analysis, wage inequality, labor economics, economic history, econometrics, geography, political science...
- 📫 How to reach me email danieljgarciajr@gmail.com ...
